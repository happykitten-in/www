### Why not Buy but Adopt?

By buying a pet, you (unknowingly) promote the nexus who force breeds parent
animals, keeping of young and old ones in unhygienic places.

"Ethics go corrupt on the way to banks."

Despite whatever any pet shop, cattery, breeder claim - they are not going
to cut profits towards vaccination, checkups and hygiene of both young and old
animals. They are not going to care for the pets like you would and could. They
may also claim, they give out pets for adoption which is their way of getting
rid of 'sick' and unwanted (sometimes old) animals they no longer want to
support. Please consider adopting pets than buying them.

### Adopting Adult Cats

Kittens are a lot of work. Between 2-6 months, they learn to socialize and their
temperament can often change. Adult cats are less work, their temperaments are
often stable and predictable, and therefore they are a great choice for
adoptions. They are also more immune, have stable routines, health and diets.
And, they can also be playful and make great pets!

You should join the [Fans of Cats Delhi](https://www.facebook.com/groups/850715891625822/)
facebook group and ask for kitten and cat adoption (have patience!) and discuss
all things cats.
