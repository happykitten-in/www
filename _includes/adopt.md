<b>Please adopt, don't shop!</b> Don't buy but adopt cats and kittens. Be
cautious of posts on OLX, Quickr, facebook or whatsapp that will try to entice
you to buy instead, the people or websites of breeder/cattery/petshop will claim
themselves as most trusted, following higher standards, they have a marketing
nexus to show you photos of their present and past customers, may even claim
that buying will make you value your future pet more, and share other lies and
excuses. Beware! Ethics are lost on the way to the banks.

Most sellers, won't keep the kittens in hygienic environment and feed them good
quality food. They won't vaccinate the (sick) kittens before they sell because
vaccinating them could kill the kittens within a week due to shock on their
immune system which may already be under stress due to an underlying infection
or genetic issue. If you meet a seller who has done first vaccination of their
kittens by 6-8 weeks, run!

The best way to get your feline friend home is through adoption.
