### Who was Happy?

"Happy was my purrfect darling kitten, he loved playing with me, hunting for
(toy) mouse on a string, chasing shadows and lasers. Everyday, he would wake me
up and play hide-n-seek with me. He would do long meows to order me to feed him.
He would get upset if I was not around him, and would wait for me near the door and
meow loudly until I would return only to go back to playing. He loved napping
near me, and I loved petting him as he would nap and purr. He was very clean,
liked grooming himself a lot, was litter trained and would demand privacy while
he would do his business. Even on his final day, he demanded and used his litter
box.

He loved treats, cantaloupe and curd. I caught him few times trying to steal his
favourite treats :) He was very curious, always keen to explore the unexplored
but only when I was around him to give assurance and a sense of security. He
also loved hiding, jumping to higher spaces, his cat tree and crashing in
soft clothes. In some sense, he was better than most humans I've met and lived
life so far. He left for the heavens when he was just 12-weeks young which
was very traumatizing and unfortunate for us, but left several great and loving
memories for us to cherish him for the rest of our lives. He was very loyal,
loving, playful, calm and docile. He will be missed üòø.

During the final days with Happy, I was ignorant and unaware about feline
first-aid and education that I always imagine could have helped. Happy and his
final days are a major reason for this website and curated pages on cats and
kitten care. At the end of this page you will find a tribute video -
*Remembering Happy*. Thank you for reading."
