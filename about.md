This website is dedicated to my beloved kitten called Happy üê±.

TODO: add story

The goal of this website is to promote cats and kittens adoption starting with
the Delhi, Gurgaon NCR region and possibly rest of the India in future. This is
meant to make it easier for people to discover adoptable kittens and cats,
educate them with curated content and discourage buying from breeders and pet
shops.

The content is curated by [Rohit Yadav](https://rohityadav.cloud). Community
reviews, edits and pull requests are also welcome. The site's source is hosted
[here](https://github.com/myhappykitten/www).
