### Feeding

You can feed your cat wet or dry or mixed (wet + dry) food. You can purchase
the cat food (both wet or dry) online or from your local vet/petstore. You can
also homecook meals, or mix homecooked meals with branded cat foods. If you
do buy branded cat food, check the expiry dates! In addition, you can buy
treats (both dry and creamy) but feed treats in limited quantities, certainly
not as a meal portion. Several (human) foods are toxic for cats/kittens such as
milk/dairy, chocolates, coffee, tea, onions, garlic, chives, alcohol, raw
fish/eggs/meat/bones, dog food, yeast/bread and fruits like grapes, raisins. Too
many treats could be toxic and can lead your cat to diabetes and obesity. Human
medicines and certain plans can be toxic as well.

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  Consult your vet about feeding option, schedules and setting up a routine.
</div>

Whatever you do decide for your cat, keep in mind that cats are very picky
eaters so start small especially when you're changing the diet/brands, and
change the diet very slowly and gradually over a period of time say 2 weeks.

Get stainless steel or ceramic bowls for feeding your cats. Stainless steel
utensils recommended. Always serve food in cleaned and dried kibble or bowls.
For kittens consider getting kibble or bowls that are shallow and not deep.

Always, ALWAYS, always have fresh, clean and potable water for your cats.
Consider changing water in the bowl 2-4 times a day. You may also get a water
fountain suitable for cats that has an in-built water filteration system.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  NEVER keep food and water bowls near the litter box!
</div>

Handy foods:
- Dry treats: these are usually meat jerkies or flakes, once opened consume that
  packet soon or they go bad fast.
- Creamy treats: useful when your cat stops eating, for both kittens and cats.
- Honey: great food when your cat stops eating but in very limited quantity
  advised (5ml or less) as it could cause heating.
- Curd: in summers, small quantities can be given during day time.
- Critical care food: keep this around, prescription or A/D food that can be
  useful especially when your cat stops eating.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  If your cat or kitten has not eaten for 12 hours or more, it is an emergency!
  Get help fast or it could be fatal.
</div>

A common issue with kittens and cats is they often stop eating which can be a
sign of illness, stress, trauma, etc. More often than not, such a situation can
become an emergency fast especially for kitten. Be very cautious. You may find
more about this and other issues on the [health](/health) page.
