As a cat parent learn and remember following vital signs and how to measure them
that can help you determine if your furry friend needs help:

- Heart rate: 140-220 beats per minute
- Temperature: 100F-103F (38.1°C to 39.2°C)
- Respiratory rate: 20-40 breaths per minute, in resting state
- Hydration Status: Pink, moist not dry skin that should span back against body instantly
- Capillary Refill Time: less than 2 seconds

### How to measure?

For **heart rate**, sense and count heart rate using the vein at the hind legs for
15seconds and multiple by 4.

For **temperature**, get a decent digital (rectal) thermometer with smaller tip that
is kept separately for your cat(s). Always wipe it clean and dry using alcohol
(get unscented after-shave) before and after its use. Use vaseline or KY jelly
to lubricate the thermometer to minimize pain for your cat. Before taking the
temperature, scruff your cat or make a cat burrito using a towel. Lift your
cat's tail and insert the thermometer about one inch into the cat's rectum
slowly (never force). Wait for some time, your thermometer should beep. Record
the temperature, wash the thermometer using water and rub alcohol, dry and store
it safely.

A temperature lower than the normal range leads to hypothermia which can be
fatal. Temperature higher than the normal range leads to hyperthermia
that can damage your cat's internal organs.

For **breathing rate**, look at your resting cat's abdomen and chest, count number
of movements in 60 seconds (avoid the 15s x 4 method to be accurate).

For **hydration status**, check your cat's gums, skin and eyes. They should appear
moist and not dry. Try to pull your cat's skin behind the neck, it should snap
back quickly if hydration status is good, otherwise the skin will take time
to snap back its place.

For **capillary refill**, press the gums of your cat and see how quickly it goes
from pale to pink.

### When to seek help?

If the vital signs are not in the normal range please reach out to your vet for
consultation. If your cat is showing other signs of illness such as loss of
apetite, lethargy, loss of muscle control etc. it could be an emergency already.
