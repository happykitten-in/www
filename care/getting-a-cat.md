title: Getting a Cat or a Kitten
---

Cats and kittens can make great pets. But before getting a forever furry buddy
home decide for yourself if you have time, capacity and energy for them. The
feline creatures are predatory by nature and most of them have a mind of their
own. While they are not very-dog like but can be still playful, loyal,
affectionate and attention seeking. Raising a cat or a kitten will at times
require a lot of patience and maturity from your side. Also note that cats are
strictly non-vegetarian beings, and will require meat as part of their daily
diet. Unlike humans and dogs, there are certain amino acids such as *Taurine*
their bodies cannot produce which is one among many reasons for a strictly
meat-rich diet.

Cats are majestic creatures, very acrobatic, noctural, clean and intelligent. In
our Indian societies they may not enjoy as appreciation as they do in the
western countries but world-wide cats are one of the most kept pets. Getting
your families and friends to accept them when you bring them could be another
 major challenge for you. So do discuss and talk about your interest before
getting your pet cat home. And, after you do get your furry friend home finding
a good vet, petstore for supplies and sitters/boarding can be other challenging
issues. We've tried to dedicate a page on local
[recommendations](/recommendations).

If you're not sure, join a local cat
[community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/850715891625822/) and ask questions,
talk to existing cat parents and see if you're a good fit for them (the cats!).

### Adopting

There are so many cats and kittens looking for great homes and new parents,
please consider adopting a kitten or an older cat than buying one. When adopting
a kitten or an older cat look if they are comfortable around you, playful and
able to socialize with other kittens/cats and people.

The best way to adopt a kitten or a cat is via your local community. If you are
unable to adopt via your friends circle consider joining your regional cat
community where you may find several adopt a kitten/cat posts with photos and
description. For Delhi/NCR region, checkout such communities, causes and
adoption events via the [recommendations](/recommendations) page or click
on the *Adopt Now* button to join the 'Fans of Cats, Delhi' group.

### Buying

Buying is highly DISCOURAGED! These are top things to keep in mind if you
knowingly decide to buy one:

- Ethics break on the way to banks, whatever stories and excuses a cat
  seller/cattery/breeder are selling via their websites, or on phone or in
  person they are (all) lies!
- Sellers induldge in force breeding leading to inbreeding and sick kittens
- Sellers seldom keep good hygience and vaccinate the kittens when they are 6-8
  weeks old, generally kittens may be sick with an underlying condition such
  that vaccinating them may be fatal
- You most likely won't let you meet the kitten's parents, or tell you lies
  about their breed/family histories, they may try to lie and fool you
- Just remember you are most likely going to get a weak and sick kitten home,
  build a bond only to lose him/her in future
- Sellers may show they give up kittens/cats for adoption which is their most
  inhumane way of getting rid of animals they failed to sell

We gave it a shot, you've been warned.

### Cat-proofing Home

Before getting your furry buddy home, ensure your home is safe for him/her.
Here are some ideas for cat-proofing your home:

- Cats are indoor pets, ensure escape routes via windows, doors etc.
- Kitchen should be kept strictly off limits if possible, there are plethora
  of dangers from sharp metal knives to flaming hot *chulha*.
- If you've a balcony, or a terrace access, get fencing done.
- If you've a garden or a bigger place like a hall, let your buddy out on lease
  and under supervision.

### Acclimatisation

After you get your furry beast home, restrict her to a single peaceful room with
access restricted to few close people. Don't expect your pet to be cuddly from
day one, give her time to adjust and acclimatise.

Consult with a vet and set a routine, if it's a kitten feed him at fixed time
3-4 times a day, if it's an adult cat feed him 2-3 times a day and provide fresh
water (change 2-3 times a day). Continue to feed the same food s/he is used to
and if you need to then slowly and gradually change the diet over a period of
1-2 weeks each time gradually increasing the new food type/brand. There are two
types of cat foods - wet and dry. Very good branded wet and dry food is
recommended if you cannot

### Trip to Vet

You may take your cat/kitten to a vet before bringing home to know about his
health status and provide suitable care. Your vet should advise you on
vaccination and deworming requirements and schedule. Usually, the vets will
advise you vaccinating your furry friend after your cat has acclimatised you and
your home.
